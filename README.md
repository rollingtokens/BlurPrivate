## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does BlurPrivate protect my privacy?

All photo processing happens locally on your device. Your photos never leave your phone - we don't collect, store, or transmit any of your media content. BlurPrivate uses Apple's Vision framework for detection, which runs entirely on your device.

### What types of blur effects are available?

BlurPrivate offers three privacy protection options: pixelate (mosaic effect), Gaussian blur (smooth blur), and emoji stickers. You can adjust the intensity of pixelate and Gaussian blur effects using the slider.

### Does BlurPrivate work offline?

Yes! BlurPrivate works completely offline. All processing is done locally on your device, so you don't need an internet connection to use the app.

### Can I edit saved works?

Yes, you can re-edit any saved work at any time. Simply go to the Works tab, tap on the work you want to edit, and make your changes.

### What is the difference between free and premium?

The free version has limitations on the number of faces and text regions that can be detected and processed. Premium subscription unlocks unlimited face detection, unlimited text recognition, unlimited photo processing, and access to all premium blur effects.

### How do I cancel my subscription?

You can cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID account settings. Go to Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions, find BlurPrivate, and tap Cancel Subscription. Your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing period.
